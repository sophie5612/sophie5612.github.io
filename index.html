          &emsp;Hi! My name is Sophie Azula and I'm a senior in college, studying Computer Science.
          I made this page to display my work and familiarize myself with HTML & CSS. 
          Admittadley, I've never been a fan of styling layouts, and this was more challenging than I thought. 
          That being said, I've done my best to make this a reactive layout and follow accessibility standards.
          Feel free to get in contact with me and give feedback!
        </p>
